### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:
- Maintain TaskFlow's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Enable a sustainable system for maintaining and reviewing contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch from `main` for your changes
3. Make your changes following our [coding standards](#coding-standards)
4. Write or adapt tests as needed
5. Update documentation as needed
6. Submit a pull request

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

## Development Workflow

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/taskflow.git
cd taskflow
```

3. Create a branch for your changes:
```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```
